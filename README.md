# Interactive-Digit-Recognition-Analyzer
It's an interactive digit recognition analyzer with an AI-assistant. It merges a traditional computer vision model with an LLM to create a unique, educational tool. The application not only predicts handwritten digits but also allows users to engage in a conversation with an AI to understand the "why" behind the model's predictions.

You need to run it using 'streamlit run app.py'
